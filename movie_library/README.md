# Movie-Watchlist
A website that allows users to create their own accounts and create a movie watchlist within that account that is only visible to them.\
 Made with html, css, and flask from the Udemy course 'Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2023' by Jose Salvatierra. \
Here is the [link](https://movie-watchlist-eyzg.onrender.com) to the deployed website. It can take a while to load due to the deployment service that I used \
so don't worry if it seems to not be loading for a bit.
